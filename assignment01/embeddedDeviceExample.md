## Wireless Speaker

A wireless speaker is an embedded device that can vary widely in complexity.  A basic speaker is comprised of an audio output module (the speaker) which has a digital to analog convertor and some form of amplifier to play the audio.  

The speaker has a method to receive the file to play; in the case of a wireless speaker, this requires a Bluetooth wireless interface for the processor.  

Additionally, the speaker needs a UI of some sort to at least toggle power, as well as any more advanced controls like controlling the volume or pausing/starting playback. On more advanced speakers, this UI may take the form of a touch screen.

The embedded system also has memory to store its program, as well as possibly configurations or audio files.

Here are just some of the challenges that a designer of a wireless speaker could encounter:

 ##### Power Consumption
 The battery life of a wireless speaker is often a key differentiating property for a consumer, so power consumption is a key design consideration. Since the audio output is somewhat of a non-negotiable power usage, the other components must be utilized efficiently and consumer as little power as possible.

 ##### Reliability
 A wireless speaker that frequently disconnects from its audio input will end up in the garbage.  Once connected, the device must reliably hold the connection. Since speakers only have a couple buttons for user interaction, the user cannot address any errors, so the software must work reliably.

 ##### Cost
 As a consumer good, cost is vital.  The speaker itself may be an unavoidably expensive component, so the rest of the device must be designed to limit the cost.
