Two's compliment is used so that both positive negative numbers can be represented in the same number of bits (without needing to incorporate a negative sign) which allows one adder circuit to be used for both addition and subtraction. Simply inversing all of the bits of a positive number (i.e. one's compliment) would mean that a positive number plus its inverse would always result in a sequence of all 1s.  Using two's compliment allows for this operation to result in a sequence of all zeros.
