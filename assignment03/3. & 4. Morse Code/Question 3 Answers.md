#### 3a. What is Morse Code?
 - Morse Code is a method for transmitting information using sequences of short and long signals (dots and dashes) to represent letters, numerals, and punctuation.  The signals can be pulses of electricity, bursts of sound, flashing lights, or any other signal that can be turned on and off in a time-controlled manner.

#### 3b. Who invented Morse Code?
- Morse code was developed by American inventor Samuel Morse for use with his invention of the electric telegraph in the early 1840s, and was further improved by Morse's partner Alfred Vail. A variation called International Morse Code was developed in 1851 by a conference of European nations to better represent other languages.
