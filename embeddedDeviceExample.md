##Wireless Speaker

A wireless speaker is an embedded device that can vary widely in complexity.  A basic speaker is comprised of an audio output module (the speaker) which has a digital to analog convertor and some form of amplifier to play the audio.  

The speaker has a method to receive the file to play; in the case of a wireless speaker, this requires a Bluetooth wireless interface for the processor.  

Additionally, the speaker needs a UI of some sort to at least toggle power, as well as any more advanced controls like controlling the volume or pausing/starting playback. On more advanced speakers, this UI may take the form of a touch screen.

The embedded system also has memory to store its program, as well as possibly configurations or audio files.

Here are just some of the challenges that a designer of a wireless speaker could encounter:

 ###Power Consumption
 The battery life of a wireless speaker is often a key differentiating property for a consumer, so power consumption is a key design consideration. Since the audio output will be in use whenever the speaker is on, the other components such as bluetooth module or the processor itself must be energy efficient.

 ###Reliability
 A wireless speaker that frequently disconnects from its audio input will end up in the garbage.  Once connected, the device must reliably hold the connection.

 ###Cost
 To produce a quality sound, the audio
